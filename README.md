# globalise
This is a quick script I made to turn any Python or Shell script into a command that can be ran from any working directory within the Terminal emulator.
Normally I'll write a simple script, such as a program that makes a backup of the entire machine and saves it to an external storage device, and I'll then use this globalise command to turn an app (ie backup.py turns into backup) into a universally ran command.
There are obviously plenty of ways to do this, however, this is the way that ended up working pretty well for me.

If, for any reason, you would like to donate- though unneccesary, is always apreciated!
